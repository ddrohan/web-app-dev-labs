#Lab 4 - Donation 4.0 (EAN Part 2)

Even though 'technically' we built a client-server web app in the previous lab, the majority of the functionality remained on the client-side (we still did everything through Angular).

In this lab we will be moving/implementing that functionality to the **NodeJS server** and making ***requests*** via our **AngularJS** front-end - the essence of a proper MEAN based Web App (without the Mongo for the moment obviously!)
