# Objectives

In this Lab, you will be required to build the next version of our Donation Case Study Web App, called **Donation 2.0**.  We will build on the previous lab, so you can either use your own version of **Donation 1.0** or download the starter code **[here](../zips/donationweb-1.0.solution.zip)**. In this version we will be updating our **controllers** and our **factory** to introduce some functionality into our Web App.  

On completion of this lab you'll be able to

* list all donations 
* add and delete a single donation
* be able to use **callbacks**
* be able to use **templates** and the **ng-view** directive
